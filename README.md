# Challenges done by me!

# What is this?

- This is just a simple project that appeared in my head and I wanted to make it.

# Project built with:

- React (React router)
- CSS modules

# What is my idea with this project?

- To show you my solutions of different challenges and receive feedback. I want to add more stuff to this project like Framer Motion and different colors, but for now I want to keep it simple because I'm learning.
